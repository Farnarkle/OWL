# OWL
DAY one on a hot Saturday afternoon in WA, just joined FreeCodeCamp and GitHub...will be a steep learning curve.
I have a strong interest in coding and computer progrqamming - have made and launched a few websites (Joomla and Wordpress) for family and friends and now want to understand how it all goes together
